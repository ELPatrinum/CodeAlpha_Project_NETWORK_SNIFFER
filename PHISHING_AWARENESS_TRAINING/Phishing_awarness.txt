### 2. **How Phishing Works**
   - **Process:**
     - Initial contact (email, SMS, phone call)

     - A call to action (clicking a malicious link, downloading an attachment, etc.)
     - Harvesting sensitive data or installing malware
   - **Common Tactics:**
     - Spoofing legitimate brands (emails/websites look almost identical to real ones)
     - Creating a sense of urgency (“Your account will be deactivated”)
     - Emotional manipulation (appealing to fear, curiosity, or greed)

### 3. **Recognizing Phishing Emails**
   - **Red Flags to Watch For:**
     - **Sender's Email:** Check for suspicious email addresses.
     - **Spelling & Grammar Errors:** Phishing emails often have typos or bad grammar.
     - **Generic Greetings:** E.g., "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
     - **Unexpected Attachments:** Never open attachments from unknown senders.
     - **Urgent Language:** Beware of scare tactics urging immediate action.
     - **Suspicious Links:** Hover over links to check their true destination.

### 4. **Avoiding Phishing Websites**
   - **Check the URL:** Ensure the domain name is correct and uses "https".
   - **Browser Warnings:** Pay attention to security warnings about suspicious sites.
   - **Pop-Ups and Forms:** Be wary of pop-ups that ask for personal or financial information.

   - **Baiting:** Offering something enticing to trick users (e.g., a free software download).
   - **Tailgating and Impersonation:** Gaining physical access to restricted areas by posing as an authorized person.

### 6. **What to Do If You Suspect a Phishing Attempt**
